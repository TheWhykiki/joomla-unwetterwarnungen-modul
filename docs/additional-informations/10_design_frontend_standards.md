- Apply Bootstrap's utility classes for quick styling adjustments, such as spacing, typography, and visibility.
- Ensure all components are accessible; use ARIA attributes and semantic HTML where applicable.

### Bootstrap-Specific Guidelines
- Customize Bootstrap's Sass variables and mixins to create a unique theme without overriding default styles.
- Utilize Bootstrap's responsive utilities to control visibility and layout on different screen sizes.
- Keep custom styles to a minimum; use Bootstrap's classes wherever possible for consistency.
- Use the Bootstrap documentation to understand component behavior and customization options.

### Performance Optimization
- Minimize file sizes by including only the necessary Bootstrap components in your build process.
- Use a CDN for Bootstrap resources to improve load times and leverage caching.
- Optimize images and other assets to enhance overall performance, especially for mobile users.

### Key Conventions
1. Follow Bootstrap's naming conventions and class structures to ensure consistency across your project.
2. Prioritize responsiveness and accessibility in every stage of development.
3. Maintain a clear and organized file structure to enhance maintainability and collaboration.
